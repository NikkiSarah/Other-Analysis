Project steps

1. Add the data to the 'assets' folder.

If you wish to run the project script by script:
    The terminal commands are typically: python -m spacy project run 'script name' (without the quotation marks)
    1. Use the 'split' script to split the training data into a train and dev set. These will appear in the assets
       folder.
    2. Use the 'convert' script to read the data into DocBin files that spacy uses during model training. The output
       should be 3 spacy files in the 'corpus' folder.
    3. The config file defines everything about the training pipeline, including the type of algorithm that will be
       applied to the data. Use the following resources to help guide how to adapt the config file for the current text
       categorisation use case:
       - https://spacy.io/usage/training
       - https://spacy.io/usage/training#config
       - https://spacy.io/api/architectures
    4. Train the model
       Delete or rename files in the training folder to re-train the model; for example, if the config file is
       changed.
    5. Evaluate the model
       python -m spacy evaluate [model e.g. training/model-best] [corpus e.g. corpus/test.spacy]
